							<h5>Abstract</h5>
							 Science is the greatest of human inventions. Through its norms and procedures, we have improved human health and longevity; we discovered the germ theory of disease, electromagnetism, and plate tectonics. But what about the health of science? Internally, we see challenges, such as the reproducibility crisis, a rise in predatory publishing and pseudoscience, and now integrity threats from generative AI. Externally, we see attacks on science through disinformation campaigns, agnotogenesis, and political point-scoring. Turning the proverbial microscope on science, I will examine some of the potential mechanisms spreading misinformation. This includes the role of perceived expertise and perceived consensus in governing online discussions about science and health related topics. I will also re-examine the reproducibility crisis, in light of varying effects, with potential impact on our own field of computational social science. Based on this work, I will end with intervention strategies for mitigating the effects of misinformation in and about science.

							<h5>Abstract</h5>
							 When estimating the risk of an adverse outcome, common statistical guidance is to include all available factors to maximize predictive performance. But I’ll argue that this popular "kitchen-sink" approach can in fact worsen predictions when the target of prediction differs from the true outcome of interest (e.g., with criminal risk assessments, predicting future arrests as a proxy for future crime). And even when predictions do improve, the benefits are often not as large as generally believed. I'll connect these results to current debates in criminal justice and healthcare.

							<h5>Abstract</h5>
							 Humans are prodigious social learners, and social learning is the engine of cumulative culture. In online social networks, algorithms mediate how we learn from others, with implications for cultural evolution in the digital age. In this talk, I will explore how social learning unfolds in online social networks, with a focus on learning and sharing moral expressions. I'll present empirical work suggesting that algorithmic amplification exploits social learning biases that evolved to promote cooperation, resulting in distorted learning about collective moral beliefs. Finally, I’ll speculate on how algorithm-mediated social learning shapes the cultural evolution of morality.

							<h5>Abstract</h5>
							 Recent language models like ChatGPT and Bard are capable of generating engaging and interesting human-like text. However, as progress on these models progresses, researchers, policy makers, and the public have raised serious concerns about their ability to generate harmful language, including language that is toxic or socially biased. In this talk, I will discuss our work at DeepMind to anticipate ethical risks in language models, then discuss how we measure toxicity and bias in our models. In particular, I'll focus on challenges operationalizing anticipated risks into reliable metrics.

							 Lisa Anne Hendricks is a research scientist at DeepMind. Her research interests include the intersection of language and vision and building fair and ethical AI. A common theme in both Lisa Anne’s multimodal and fairness research is probing whether models understand human language or whether they rely on learned correlations, with an aim to both accurately measure and mitigate potential failure modes. At DeepMind, Lisa has led the fairness analysis on many of DeepMind's large models including Gopher, Chinchilla, and Sparrow. She graduated with her PhD from UC Berkeley in 2019, where she focused on image captioning and text-based video retrieval. She completed her undergraduate studies at Rice University in 2013.

							<h5>Abstract</h5>
							 Transport emissions continue to grow, with very limited evidence of future change: Demand seems to continuously grow, outpacing efficiency gains. This raises the question of the social drivers of transport demand, such as social media, travel influencers, digital nomadism, and the aspirational lifestyles of the carbon elites, as underfeeding personal identities, social norms, and social capital generation. Given the evidence that technology innovations appear to constantly increase demand for travel and transport, the question is raised whether the arrival of AI represents an Avenger moment. Can we trust technology to support the transport transition?

							<h5>Abstract</h5>
							 Suddenly those of us who work in and with AI have moved from the academic margins into a whirlwind of power, money, international security, and hype. Fortunately, computational social sciences can help us understand these new contexts, and likely consequences of technological (and climactic) transformations. In this talk I review primarily simulation results explaining that cooperation is natural, despotism is too (in some contexts), trust depends on absence of information, and polarisation on economic precarity. I then pivot to data science supporting the polarisation model, and then showing the power dynamics of at least some of the transnational AI regulatory games we are observing.

							<h5>Abstract</h5>
							 Access to mental health care falls short of meeting the significant need. More than one billion individuals are affected by mental health conditions, with the majority not receiving the necessary treatment. I will describe how human-AI collaboration, critically enabled by language models, can improve access and quality of mental health support. Lacking access to professional care or complementing it, millions of people turn to online peer support communities. While potentially highly beneficial and significantly more accessible, peer supporters are rarely trained in providing effective support. To train peer supporters, we developed a human-AI collaboration tool that teaches how to express empathy effectively, leveraging language models and reinforcement learning. A randomized trial with peer supporters from Talklife, the largest peer support platform globally, demonstrates that actionable, just-in-time AI feedback leads to conversations with higher empathy, outperforming traditional training methods. We further demonstrate how a human-AI collaboration approach can teach individuals how to reframe negative thoughts. Enabled by recent advances in language models, this approach makes the evidence-based intervention of cognitive restructuring widely accessible and easier to engage with. Findings from a randomized field study on the Mental Health America platform with over 50,000 participants, demonstrate far superior engagement and completion rates compared to a non-AI-supported intervention and inform psychological theory regarding which types of reframes lead to a range of positive outcomes. My hope is that as a community and for the collective benefit of society, we will leverage these insights and advances in technology to develop social and communication technology that considers or helps improve mental health for all.

							<h5>Abstract</h5>
							 Friendship is crucial for human health and well-being. People who are socially isolated have a greater risk of heart disease than heavy smokers, drinkers, and the obese, and halting social isolation’s ongoing rise is a growing priority for public health and political policy. Coming to grips with our need for friends requires we not only look at how friendship is manifested in contemporary societies but to its origins in our evolutionary past. Yet, the evolutionary origins of friendship and the degree to which friendship’s components reflect human specializations are unclear. My research explores the social networks of other animals to establish the causes and consequences of friendship in evolutionary time and the extent of its human uniqueness. Here, I will show that friendly relationships not only exist outside of humans but are used by other animals to cope with challenges in their environments, with consequences for individual health and longevity. Where my research may differ in the disciplinary perspective it draws from compared to other computational social scientists, we can find common ground in the tools we use and the limitations they can impose on our work. The density of a monkey grooming network is as much a point estimate as the density of a human association network – neither provide us an indication of certainty. My group has thus developed BISoN, a Bayesian framework for inference of social networks generated from observational data. I will introduce BISoN, and show how it generates uncertainty around edges, which can be carried forward into downstream statistical analyses.

							<h5>Abstract</h5>
							 The economic and social progress of our urban areas, institutions, and labor markets depend on the diversity and resilience of the social fabric in cities. However, several major forces can erode these connections, such as income or racial segregation and differences in education and job access. In this talk, I will present recent research on understanding the fragility of the network of social connections and interactions in cities by analyzing behavioral mobility data and its relationship with networked inequalities, such as experienced segregation, access to healthy food, and adaptation to the recent pandemic. I will also discuss potential data-driven interventions aimed at reinforcing the social fabric in cities and mitigating the detrimental impacts of networked inequalities.
